# Ria Money Transfer - Weather App

Emphasis for this assignment was put on getting the basic functionality outlined in the project document up and running: Allowing the user to fetch weather data from the Open Weather API for the 3 cities provided in the mock up and displaying it to them in a user friendly way.

If this was real production code, there would still be a lot of work to be done, including the following:

1. Storing the API key in an env variable instead of hardcoding
2. Updating dates to display in timezone of city instead of local timezone
3. Installing a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less
4. More organized / structure CSS
5. Styling fine tuning / polish
6. Loader animations
7. Better day long weather description
8. Defensive coding for bad data received from API
9. Search functionality
